<p>
1) Always keep your main door closed. Provide it with a peephole.
Fix a metal grill or collapsible gate outside the main door, which will provide you the visibility without exposing you to threats.
Ensure that the window grills are not screwed into the frames, but embedded in the cement work.
Whenever you move into a new house, change the main door and back door locks.
<br>
<br>
2) Switch on outside lights during nighttime.
When you go out, switch on at least one inside light, to give the impression that the house is not empty.
There are timer mechanisms available in the market, which control lights. If you are planning to be away from home for some days, install one of these gadgets.
<br>
<br>
3) The city police provide a free service to the public. When you are going out of station, you can inform to the local station the duration of your absence. The beat constables will keep watch regularly.
<br>
<br>
4) Keep touch with the beat police constables while they are coming to your area and keep them informed of even minor incidences. This will prevent major crimes in future.
Don't allow strangers who claim to be mechanics / messengers / sales people to enter, without thoroughly checking their credentials. Train your watchman also to do so.

<center><h1>Tips for Foreigners</h1></center>

<h5>Keep the address to your accommodation.</h5> 
In both English and the native tongue written in both your phone's notes (or snap a photo) and in a little notebook (phone batteries die). Everyone in your group should do this as reality is, you might lose your friends.

<h5>Get travel insurance and register with S.T.E.P.</h5> 
If your insurance doesn't already cover you overseas. I know heaps of people (usually British for some reason) who get injured overseas and have to head home or pay medical costs up front. Register with S.T.E.P. (Smart Traveler Enrollment Program)

<h5>If you're walking alone at night.</h5>
Walk slightly behind a couple. It sounds a little creepy, but you don't want to stand out as walking alone. Especially as a girl, the couple you could be following will usually get the vibe with a smile. Obviously, don't follow them home, but stay on the same side of the street as them.

<h5>Avoid dark or non-tourist areas at night.</h5>
If you do feel uncomfortable, switch train cars or walk into very busy areas such as a restaurant.

<h5>If you do think you are being followed.</h5>
Stop to ask security or a public place for help. You can walk into a hotel that's not yours to ask for help. Whatever you do, don't walk to where you're staying.

<h5>Keep money in more than one location.</h5>
In case some is robbed.

<h5>Get a sturdy bag. Wear your backpack facing front.</h5> 
Not something with a thin strap that can be broken, nor a clutch that can be grabbed, nor a wallet in a front or back pocket. My friend literally caught a woman's hand in his pocket in a metro in Barcelona. Another friend had his backpack back pocket unzipped and things taken in Italy. If you look like a tourist (which you do), you're a target for professionals!

<h5>Don't bring attention to yourself as being a tourist.</h5>
Especially if alone or in a small group.

<h5>If you're taking public transport to a night club or to meet up with friends for social outing.</h5> 
You might be somewhere where the culture is for a more conservative attire, so you may feel more comfortable covering up or wearing a coat until you get to the venue. Or bring clothes to change at your friends' so that when you are in your youthful attire, you're in a group and not alone.

<h5>Just don't get too drunk.</h5> 
It seems obvious, but you're in a foreign country, so you're a target for all types of crimes just by being a tourist; being drunk just multiplies that risk by like a 1,000 (not actual statistic).

<h5>Lock Up!</h5>
Lock your windows and doors, hide everything inside, and keep a lock on your belongings.

<h5>Ask questions regarding public transport.</h5>
Maybe the train or bus will take you to Point B, but once at Point B, there won't be any cabs for the rest of your night's journey. Maybe something is available throughout the entire night, but only in increments of every couple hours. 

<h5>If you anticipate feeling really unsafe, pay the $20 - $40 to get an international sim card.</h5> 
You can pop this into your iPhone and have internet everywhere. Google Maps you will generally show you where a cab is taking you and Google Translate can help ou ask locals questions.

<h5>Don't wear jewelry.</h5> 
Unless you're staying in a luxury hotel and have their private cabs driving you and picking you up.

<h5>Don't take cabs that aren't registered with the city.</h5>
"Private Cars" 

<h5>If you're traveling alone or in a small group, try to meet people during the day to hang out with at night.</h5> 
Not that new friends couldn't be creepers too, but odds are your judgment is better in daylight and sober.

<h5>Book up on boozin'.</h5> 
The alcohol content in some beers is almost twice as much as American beers. A single vodka soda in Sydney is actually legally calculated, so a vodka soda in Europe could be three to four times stronger.

<h5>Don't leave your drink unattended.</h5> 
Anywhere.

<h5>Keep your friends and family posted on where you are.</h5> 
Mostly, just to keep them sane.

<h5>You can join a tour group or meet up with friends of friends.</h5>
To still get that independence (not committing 24/7 to a travel buddy), but having someone around when you want them.

Never leave your doors open or unlocked.
Fit your front and back door with security gates (metal grills) for added protection.

A bright outside light is a good deterrent to potential burglars.

Keep your emergency numbers close at hand so that you have them available in the event of an emergency (neighbours, your doctor, the fire brigade, ambulance, police, close relative)
